1. Feed Refiner
Feed Refiner is a Chrome extension that uses a large language model (LLM) to intelligently filter your LinkedIn feed. It empowers you to take control of your professional browsing by blurring or hiding content that you find distracting, unprofessional, or irrelevant.

How It Works
Customizable Filtering: You define what "cringe" content is by selecting from a list of categories in the extension's popup.

AI-Powered Analysis: The extension's background script sends the text of each LinkedIn post to an AI model for analysis.

Real-time Moderation: Based on the AI's response, the extension automatically blurs or removes posts that match your selected categories.
